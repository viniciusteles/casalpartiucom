<h1>Who is Casal Partiu?</h1>

<p><a href="http://patriciafigueira.com/">Patricia Figueira</a> takes picture of weddings. <a href="http://viniciusteles.com/">Vinícius Teles</a>&nbsp;builds software. They lived in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) until 2010, when they sold everything and began to travel the world. "Casal Partiu" is a Portuguese expression that means "the couple that went away".</p>

<p>
Their journey took them to countries like&nbsp;Argentina, Uruguai, Chile, Colômbia, Venezuela, Curaçao, Estados Unidos, França, Espanha, Itália, Alemanha, Austrália, Nova Zelândia, Japão, Índia, Tailândia, China, Taiwan, Coreia do Sul, Emirados Árabes Unidos, Líbano, Jordânia, Egito, Malásia, Turquia, Grécia, Suíça, República Tcheca, Suécia, Guernsey, Finlândia, Georgia, &nbsp;among others.</p>

<p>
They both work regularly on a daily basis, while they travel. <a href="http://viniciusteles.com/">Vinícius</a> writes software for his own company, <a href="http://improveit.com.br/">Improve It</a>. He does it remotely, from wherever he's at. That's how he maintains his company's main product <a href="http://beonthe.net/">Be on the Net</a>.<br /><br />They come back to Brazil each year for a period of three to four months so that <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com/">Patricia</a> can shoot some weddings. Afterwards, when they leave the country again, <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com/">Patricia</a> works on the post processing of the wedding pictures and the design of the wedding albums. She does it from wherever she's at.</p>
