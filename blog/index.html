<p>This beautiful picture was taken by <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ohrid">Ohrid</a>, where we arrived today. It&#8217;s a beautiful town, by the lake, in an European country that has a very <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute">controversial name</a>. It calls itself <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Republic of Macedonia</a>. But, in international organizations, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations">UN</a>, the country is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute">FYROM</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute">Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia</a>). The Greeks, their neighbors, don&#8217;t agree with the use of the name <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a> for several reasons.</p>

<p>As a Brazilian, no matter how much I try to understand the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute">controversy around the name</a>, I believe I can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t take sides. As in all kinds of complex controversies, each side has a long list of arguments to defend their views. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I prefer to be completely out of this discussion.</p>

<p>But, when I talk about this country, I have to choose a name, so that I can communicate about it. I choose to write <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, just because it&#8217;s simpler, not because I support one side or the other.</p>

<p>I have Greek friends that I like a lot and I know they don&#8217;t approve this use, as much as I have friends in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a> that don&#8217;t approve the other use. I want all of you to know that I&#8217;ll use <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a> because whichever name I choose, people will be upset with me. Please just know that I still love you guys. I just want to simplify my writing. Remember, I&#8217;m not taking sides.</p>

<h2>The Balkans</h2>

<p>Having said that, let me tell you what has happened in the last weeks. While most people were parting in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Brazil">Brazil</a>, during <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival">Carnival</a>, we were very far from the party, in a country that most Brazilians don&#8217;t know much about, called <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a>.</p>

<p>We didn&#8217;t have any expectations about it. But it turned out to be one of the most amazing surprises we&#8217;ve ever had in ours trips. The reason for that is simple: people.</p>

<p>The people of <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a> treated us like we&#8217;ve never been treated before outside of <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Brazil">Brazil</a>. To the point that I believe Serbians are the closest that you could possibly get from Brazilians in so many ways. The only noticeable difference is that they smoke way more than Brazilians, which is sad. Apart from that, we&#8217;re incredibly similar. Both peoples are absolutely warm and friendly.</p>

<p>From the moment we stepped in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a> to the moment we left it, we&#8217;ve been busy meeting people. The days we spent in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a>&#8217;s capital city, were so intense and joyful that we had a hard time to leave the city. So much so, that we extended our stay twice. And we would stay much longer, but our curiosity to visit the other countries in the <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Balkans">Balkans</a> forced us to move on.</p>

<p>Our stay in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a> will be remembered forever as one of the best parts of our trips, along with places like <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Turkey">Turkey</a> and a few others. Eventually we managed to come to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a> (greek friends, pretend you read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_naming_dispute">FYROM</a> and don&#8217;t be upset, please).</p>

<p>We took a bus from <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Belgrade">Belgrade</a> to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a>, spent a night in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a>, then took another bus to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Skopje">Skopje</a>, the capital city of <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a>, where we planed to stay for two nights.</p>

<h2>The &#8220;hangover&#8221;</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the intense days in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Belgrade">Belgrade</a> left some consequences. And <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> was the one who felt them.</p>

<p>She arrived in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Skopje">Skopje</a> feeling quite bad. Coughing, tired and with fever. The weather wasn&#8217;t good, which only made things worse. Eventually we had to see a doctor.</p>

<p>Visiting a doctor is always undesirable when we&#8217;re traveling, but once again we got lucky. We asked our <a href="https://airbnb.com/rooms/579046">Airbnb hosts</a> to recommend us a doctor, or a hospital. What they did instead was amazing and, at the same time, an example of how awesome people can be in this part of the world. They sent me a message saying: one of us is coming to pick you up in a few minutes and take you to the hospital. And that&#8217;s exactly what happened.</p>

<p>Our host came by car and took us to an excellent private hospital. He talked in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonian_language">Macedonian</a> with the receptionist and an English-speaking doctor saw <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> about half an hour later.</p>

<p>Given the symptoms, we thought she could be suffering of pneumonia, but fortunately, the doctor confirmed that this wasn&#8217;t the case. She had bronchitis, probably caused and aggravated by several days with not enough sleep and exposure to a lot of smoke, since in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a>, people smoke a lot, even in closed places. This is the only complain we have about <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Serbia">Serbia</a>, by the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> got a prescription and we headed back to the receptionist. Time to make the payment and find out how much it costed to see the doctor. The price was 800 Macedonian Denars, which is equivalent to US$ 18.</p>

<p>I was in shock, since I expected it to be much higher. I mean, this is <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Europe">Europe</a>, after all. True, it&#8217;s not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe">Western Europe</a>. Still, US$ 18 is quite cheap to see a doctor.</p>

<p>We have insurance and I could claim a reimbursement, but seriously, I won&#8217;t even care to do that. The time and effort it will take me, just don&#8217;t pay off.</p>

<p>We extended our stay in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Skopje">Skopje</a>, so that <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> could recover and she was enough better today, that we could finally come to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ohrid">Ohrid</a>, which happens to be one the most beautiful places in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Republic_of_Macedonia">Macedonia</a>. Specially today, when we had this incredibly beautiful weather.</p>

<h2>Low cost around the Balkans</h2>

<p>By the way, speaking of low costs, my jaw dropped when I realized that I could rent an excellent apartment, with good reviews and all kinds of things that we generally need, in an excellent location, close to the lake, for only 17 Euros per/night (for the whole apartment).</p>

<p>Yes, I know it&#8217;s low season, but still, 17 Euros for an apartment like this, is quite unbelievable. The host is great (even picked us up in the bus station) and the apartment turns out to be even better than expected.</p>

<p>Once again, we&#8217;ll have to extend our stay.  This place is just perfect to work, enjoy, take great pictures and spend some time.</p>

<p>For what we could see so far, the <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Balkans">Balkans</a> turn out to be one of the most amazing and underrated destinations we&#8217;ve ever been to. Really glad that we&#8217;re here and quite curious to visit the next destinations in the region.</p>

<p>By the way, we recorded lots of videos in the places that we&#8217;ve visited before, like <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Sofia">Sofia</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Veliko_Turnovo">Velinko Tarnovo</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Sinaia">Sinaia</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Brasov">Brasov</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Sibiu">Sibiu</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Timi%C5%9Foara">Timişoara</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Novi_Sad">Novi Sad</a>, <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ni%C5%A1">Niš</a> and <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Skopje">Skopje</a>. As you can imagine, it&#8217;s a lot of work to edit and publish all of them. It&#8217;s specially challenging because I have to balance this with my regular work. Still, I&#8217;m doing my best and hopefully you&#8217;ll have a chance to see some cool videos very soon.</p>

<p>For now, please enjoy some of the incredbily beautiful pictures that <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> took around here.</p>

			Would you travel for 14 years? Earl did it.</a>

<p>We took the wrong car in the Metro. But that&#8217;s how we met <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/about/">Earl</a>, by chance. It happened here, in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, a few days ago.</p>

<p>Who is <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/about/">Earl</a>, by the way? He&#8217;s the guy who taught me how to come from <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Romania">Romania</a> by land. Or, most importantly, he&#8217;s the person who&#8217;s been traveling for over 14 years.</p>

<p>We were in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> a few days ago trying to figure out how to come to <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Romania">Romania</a>, from <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Veliko_Turnovo">Velinko Ternovo</a>, in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>. I searched on Google and I found <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/">Earl&#8217;s blog</a>, called <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/">Wandering Earl</a>. He made the trip the other way around. Still, the information he shared was very useful to us.</p>

<p>That would be more than enough to make my day. But <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/">his blog</a> turns out to be very good and useful. I couldn&#8217;t stop reading it and I learned a ton about other countries in the <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Balkans">Balkans</a>, which we&#8217;ll be visiting soon.</p>

<p>I knew he was in <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Romania">Romania</a>, but I thought he&#8217;d probably be too busy. I didn&#8217;t plan to contact him or anything like that.</p>

<p>Imagine my astonishment when I saw him in front of me in the Metro car! It was him, <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/about/">Earl</a>. It was the most bizarre experience I&#8217;ve had in a long time. What are the odds of this happening? And I even took the subway in the wrong direction by mistake, which rarely happens to me.</p>

<p>I spent so much time reading his articles in the last few days and all of the sudden he was standing in front of me, in the subway of a big city. You don&#8217;t bump into a celebrity in the Metro everyday, right? Nor do I. And, being an introvert, I thought to myself: what do I do? Should I talk to him?</p>

<p>I told <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com">Pati</a> about it and she said: you must talk to him now. If you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll do it. A small discussion between us followed. Somehow I found the courage to say: hi, are you <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/about/">Earl</a>?</p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://www.wanderingearl.com/about/">Earl</a> is a nice guy, as I was about to find out. He was also amazed by the coincidence when I told him what was happening.</p>

<p>I contacted him later, we had dinner together and it was such a pleasure to talk to him. Then I figured out that my friends should also have a chance to hear what he has to say about permanent traveling.</p>

<p>I invited him for this interview and he was once again very generous with his time. He has a wonderful perspective on several topics. And I think it&#8217;s pretty hard to dismiss your desire to travel after watching what he has to say in this video.</p>

<p>Would you have his courage and travel permanently for most of your adult life?</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;d never come to this place if you haven&#8217;t brought me here. What a fantastic place!&#8221; That&#8217;s what we said many times in the past, when a friend guided us around a city he or she was living in.</p>

<p>The experience of visiting a new place is so much better when we have a chance to see it through the eyes of a person who lives there. Besides the touristic spots, we have the opportunity to visit hidden parts of the city that locals go to quite often, but the tourists don&#8217;t even imagine that exist. And you know what? Those are typically the best parts.</p>

<p>Here, in Istanbul, we&#8217;ve met <a href="http://www.turistambul.com/pt/#!/page_Services">Michele</a>, a Brazilian lady who&#8217;s been living here for almost a decade. After showing the city to so many friends in the past, she realized she could go beyond that. She created a concierge service and began to show Istanbul to people from all over the world, exactly in the same way she was doing before with her friends.</p>

<p>The concierge service eventually became an agency called <a href="http://www.turistambul.com">Turistambul</a>. The best part of it is the personalized experience that <a href="http://www.turistambul.com/pt/#!/page_Services">Michele</a> delivers, which mix the classic tourism with local and authentic aspects of the city, known only by those living here. This mix and her kindness have been attracting many tourists from all over the world.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve spent several days with <a href="http://www.turistambul.com/pt/#!/page_Services">Michele</a> recently, since <a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> was shooting pictures for a promotional campaign featuring <a href="http://www.turistambul.com">Turistambul</a>. At the end, <a href="http://www.turistambul.com/pt/#!/page_Services">Michele</a> managed to set aside some time and we interviewed her.</p>

<p><a href="http://patriciafigueira.com.br">Pati</a> and <a href="http://www.viniciusteles.com.br">I</a> don&#8217;t do a lot of tourism ourselves. But Istanbul is such an amazing city. Many people would love to come here for a few days and do some tourism. That&#8217;s why we thought it was worth to ask <a href="http://www.turistambul.com/pt/#!/page_Services">Michele</a> a bit more about what one can expect when visiting Istanbul.</p>

<p>Having a haircut abroad is always a bit intimidating. We don&#8217;t even know if we&#8217;ll be understood. This time I had my haircut in Turkey and decided to record this experience to show what is special about it.</p>

			How to be a world traveler?</a>

  <img border="0" height="424" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wGGcYdb-ofg/USVqPKshglI/AAAAAAAAASI/bkGWkr_MFYg/s640/_DSC0270.jpg" width="640">
</center>
<p>
  Are you curious to know how to be a world traveler? It&#8217;s not easy, but maybe for reasons different than you imagine.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Money</b>
</p>
<p>
  Money is the first thing that comes to mind. So, lets get it out of the way from the outset.
</p>
<p>
  People think you&#8217;ll need a lot of money to travel around the world constantly. But this is not necessarily true. In fact, I&#8217;d claim that a couple, earning what an office job would generally pay in a developed country, or even in some developing countries like Brazil, might be enough. I&#8217;m talking about a double income here, but not necessarily a big income for each person.
</p>
<p>
  This means that, theoretically, it&#8217;s much more affordable than most people would imagine, right? But how is that so? Well, actually, the trick is not so much the paycheck. Having sort of an average salary will probably do. What&#8217;s really critical is what you stop paying.
</p>
<p>
  It takes a lot of money to live in developed countries and certain cities of developing countries, like Rio and São Paulo, just to mention two that I&#8217;m very familiar with. Housing consumes a big share of the salaries, along with car, other kinds of transport, utilities and other monthly bills.
</p>
<p>
  That&#8217;s why traveling tends to be so expensive. When you travel, you keep paying your regular bills and, on top of that, the travel expenses. But what if you don&#8217;t have to pay the regular bills back home anymore? That&#8217;s precisely where the magic happens.
</p>
<p>
  Since Patricia and I don&#8217;t have a house anymore, nor in Brazil, nor anywhere else, we don&#8217;t have to pay for these fixed bills that everybody else is paying. Whatever we earn can be used to support our trips.
</p>
<p>
  It turns out that very often we&#8217;re spending less on a daily basis being away from Brazil. I remember vividly the last time we spent a few months in Brazil, by the end of 2012. I had to use my credit card every day, several times a day, for things like food, groceries and stuff. These purchases felt kind of expensive to me most of the time. But, since we were there, there was little I could do about it.
</p>
<p>
  Here in Istanbul, my credit card is having vacations. It&#8217;s rarely used. Why? Because our daily expenses are so much lower that I don&#8217;t even bother to use the card. I just pay cash, since it takes a long time to use all the cash I take from the ATM every time I have to visit it.
</p>
<p>
  So, yes, we had to pay to fly here. But, once we&#8217;re here, everything is less expensive. And I should mention that Istanbul isn&#8217;t necessarily a cheap city. Maybe it was in the past. But it&#8217;s not so much the case anymore. Still, it&#8217;s much more affordable than Rio.
</p>
<p>
  Again, we&#8217;re paying less here, but we paid for the air ticket. If we sum everything up and average it, we spend about the same that we used to pay monthly in Brazil or less. So, strangely enough, traveling didn&#8217;t necessarily make us spend more. And in other parts of the world that we&#8217;ve visited before, we used to spend even less.
</p>
<p>
  All of this explanation serves just one purpose: showing that the amount of money you make isn&#8217;t really the differentiator here. It doesn&#8217;t take that much money to do what we do. But, if you only have a kind of average salary it will probably be essential to stop paying bills at your home country. I realize this can be tricky, since many people have mortgages. Fortunately, we don&#8217;t. And by the way, we don&#8217;t have kids, either. But I know people who have and travel the world too.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Time</b>
</p>
<p>
  Now we can begin to address the things that are way harder than money. And time might be exactly one of the most difficult ones. Or, should I say more accurately, freedom to use your time as you wish.
</p>
<p>
  Patricia and I work regularly, but we work from &#8220;home&#8221; on our own businesses, back in Brazil. Because of that, we have complete freedom to use our time however we like. This doesn&#8217;t mean we choose to spend our days by the beach sipping caipirinhas. Actually we rarely do that. But we can do that whenever we want. And that&#8217;s the big difference!
</p>
<p>
  Most importantly we can move to anywhere, anytime, because we&#8217;re not constrained by an office work. It took us years to earn this kind of freedom, but eventually we achieved it.
</p>
<p>
  We have our businesses, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. Fortunately, more and more companies are hiring remote workers. So, maybe what you need to do is finding a remote job, so that you can have more control over the use of your own time. By the way, since it&#8217;s your own time, isn&#8217;t it more natural that you control it, instead of other people? ;-)
</p>
<p>
  <b>English</b>
</p>
<p>
  To me, the most fundamental skill is the ability to communicate in English. Some people are lucky enough to be raised in a mostly English speaking country. That wasn&#8217;t our case, since we&#8217;re Brazilians and speak Portuguese natively.
</p>
<p>
  We had to learn English well enough to at least make ourselves understood. Not necessarily to chat with Americans, nor Brits, but with people all over the world. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you like English or not, for better or worse, that&#8217;s the language that you can almost always count on.
</p>
<p>
  Wherever you are in the world you will almost always find someone who can speak at least a bit of English to help you out. But even if that were not the case, there&#8217;s a ton of things that you can do with the help of the internet if you can at least read English.
</p>
<p>
  Sadly, most Brazilians have very poor English skills, if any. I guess they know that. But I don&#8217;t believe they realize how tragic the situation is, compared to the rest of the world. It&#8217;s really, really bad. I have to laugh in Turkey when I see people complaining that many Turks don&#8217;t speak any English at all. They should pay a visit to Brazil.
</p>
<p>
  Speaking of that, here in Istanbul I met only two people that have visited Brasil. One Turk and one Algerian. Both reported the same thing: while in Rio, a touristic city, they couldn&#8217;t find a single soul they could have a conversation with in English. Both spent at least a week in the most touristic part of Rio, and yet, no luck for them. I wonder how they survived and I&#8217;m particularly curious about the World Cup next year.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Planning</b>
</p>
<p>
  Planning comes next. And this one was really hard for me. You see, I&#8217;m a Brazilian. Two important things about this lovely people from South America: most of them don&#8217;t speak English, but you already know that, and they don&#8217;t plan. It&#8217;s all about spontaneity. :-)
</p>
<p>
  Now, seriously, planning isn&#8217;t the most developed skill among Brazilians, but on the other hand, we&#8217;re super flexible and we adapt fast.
</p>
<p>
  I used to have such a hard time when I began to travel like that. Because I really needed to plan and it was a torture to me. But, fortunately this time is over and now I plan like a pro, simply because I desperately need to. Which means, by the way, that being organized is quite essential to live this kind of life.
</p>
<p>
  And since we&#8217;re at it, let&#8217;s talk about focus. Do you realize how much surrounded by distractions we are? This very article is probably a distraction for you now, since you should be working, right? :-)
</p>
<p>
  The most difficult thing is really to keep focus on what we have to do. Specially if you consider that we&#8217;re often in such amazing places, that we want to go around all of the time to explore it. Istanbul, just to mention one, is completely mind blowing in every possible way. I can&#8217;t tell you how much I love this place and will suffer when we move somewhere else. So how to keep the focus on the work?
</p>
<p>
  I don&#8217;t have an answer for that. Maybe we&#8217;ve trained enough and traveled enough to be at peace now, even when we&#8217;re at home, working voluntarily, while this fantastic city is out of the door waiting for us.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway, I think now the planning helps me a lot to keep the focus. I plan the week, I prioritize tasks and I execute them as well as focuses as I can during the week. But even this is something that I only began to do recently, after struggling with planning for so long.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Positive attitude</b>
</p>
<p>
  Out of our country &#8220;strange&#8221; things happen. People are different, the culture is different, the food is different and we don&#8217;t know exactly how things work. Although everybody around us looks like ETs, it&#8217;s actually the other way around. We are the ETs. We are the strangers. So, we can&#8217;t be too demanding, right?
</p>
<p>
  Keeping a positive attitude in the face of the uncommon situations that may arise is quite important. But, don&#8217;t worry, most of the time everything is just fine. And as long as we remind ourselves that we are the actual ETs, it all goes well.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Permanent training on change management</b>
</p>
<p>
  The first time I backpacked around Europe, it was overwhelming. I&#8217;d change countries every night, traveling by train.
</p>
<p>
  In the morning, I&#8217;d arrive in a new city, in a new country, with a language I didn&#8217;t speak, a currency that I didn&#8217;t understand yet, a people that seemed strange and streets that I didn&#8217;t know how to navigate. In the beginning, it was a lot of stress and worries.
</p>
<p>
  Eventually I realized that every morning was weird because of so many changes, but by noon I was already acclimatized to the new place and by sunset I felt like a local, proud of my knowledge of a few streets and places. Only to change everything again on the next morning.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that whichever stress I had in the morning was latter replaced by an amazing feeling of joy and gratitude for all of the cool places I was having the chance to visit and the nice people I eventually met.
</p>
<p>
  We don&#8217;t travel so frantically these days. But it doesn&#8217;t matter. We became used to changes and I think this is wonderful. Cause, as cliché as this might be, truth is that change is the only constant in life. So learning to live with it and actually welcoming it, is like a blessing for us. It&#8217;s a sort of permanent training that help us to improve everyday and keep us well alive.
